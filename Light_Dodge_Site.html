<h3>Description of Project</h3>

<p> The Light Dodge game is a multi- step action game that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The Game will begin at the press of the .jar file. The difficulty starts slowly, but gets harder each 5 points after you start the game. A game should be completed when you run out of life. Remember to avoid enemies, and play as long as possible. The last time you fail to avoid an enemy, your game is over. The game will begin at the press of the .jar file. On your mark, get ready, start. </p>
